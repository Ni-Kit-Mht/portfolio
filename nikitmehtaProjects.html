            <p class="project-description">
                In minor project, we group of 3 people decided to make a pollution measuring device that sends its data over to a website. I contributed to the project by using a ESP 32 chip and connecting various components like GSM module, air sensor. For the website, I build a local network connecting the ESP 32 to my localhost through http requests and responses to share the data as collected by the air sensor.

            <p class="project-description">
                In major project, we group of 3 people decided to perform a churn analysis on data of employee of a bank. We used ANN, logistic regression, random forest algorithms to compute the various graphs and visualization methods for comparison among the seperate algorithms. We made a recommendation system that has search, user input and recommendations to user using cosine similarity, TF-IDF vectorization algorithm. We used streamlit as development tool.
                We also added a feedback for users to input.
